4. Conclusion
4.1. Model Specifics
4.2. Model Performance Comparison



Here are the algorithms:

K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
Linear regression
Logistic regression
Naive Bayes
Decision trees
Random Forests
AdaBoost
Neural networks
Here are the dimensions for comparison:

Problem type (classification/regression)
Results interpretable by you?
Easy to explain algorithm to others?
Average predictive accuracy
Training speed
Prediction speed
Amount of parameter tuning needed (excluding feature selection)
Performs well with small number of observations?
Handles lots of irrelevant features well (separates signal from noise)?
Automatically learns feature interactions?
Gives calibrated probabilities of class membership?
Parametric?
Features might need scaling?
